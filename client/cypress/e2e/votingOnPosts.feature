Feature: Voting on Posts
    As a user of the platform
    I want to upvote, downvote, undo, and switch my votes on questions and answers
    So that I can help promote or discourage content based on quality, with accurate vote counts and visual feedback

    Scenario: Upvoting a post
        Given The user is logged in and viewing a post
        When The user clicks the "Upvote" button
        Then The vote count next to the post should increase by 1
        And The "Upvote" button should be visually highlighted

    Scenario: Downvoting a post
        Given The user is logged in and viewing a post
        When The user clicks the "Downvote" button
        Then The vote count next to the post should decrease by 1
        And The "Downvote" button should be visually highlighted

    Scenario: Undoing a vote
        Given The user is logged in and has previously upvoted or downvoted a post
        When The user clicks the same vote button again
        Then The vote count should update accordingly:
            | Action           | Vote Change |
            | Undoing Upvote   | -1          |
            | Undoing Downvote | +1          |
        And Both vote buttons should return to the unselected state

    Scenario: Displaying the vote count
        Given The user is logged in and viewing a post
        When The post loads on the page
        Then The vote count should show the difference between total upvotes and downvotes

    Scenario: Viewing previous votes
        Given The user is logged in and has already voted on a post
        When The user visits that post again
        Then The vote button representing the userâ€™s previous vote should appear highlighted

        Then The vote should not be registered
        And The vote count should remain unchanged
        And The user should see an error message: "You cannot vote on your own post"

        When The user clicks the upvote or downvote button more than once within 5 seconds
        Then The system should block the repeated vote
        And The user should see an error message: "You have already voted on this post. Please wait for sometime before voting again."

    Scenario: Preventing rapid voting across multiple posts
