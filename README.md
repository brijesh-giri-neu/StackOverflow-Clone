# StackOverflow-Clone  

A full-stack Q&A web application inspired by Stack Overflow, built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It replicates the core functionality of StackOverflow to provide a dynamic space for developers to ask questions, share knowledge, and engage in discussions.

## Features  
- **Q&A system** â€“ Users can post, search, and answer questions and comment on existing answers  
- **Sorting & Filtering** â€“ View questions by recent activity, unanswered status, and search by tags
- **Voting system** â€“ Upvote and downvote questions & answers for community-driven quality control
- **RESTful APIs** â€“ CRUD operations for questions, answers, and user interactions  
- **Pagination & Form Validation** â€“ Ensuring structured data input and smooth navigation
- **Custom Hooks & Factory Pattern** â€“ Modularized UI logic and routing management  
- **End-to-End Testing with Cypress** â€“ Validating UI behavior and core functionalities   

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, MVVM Architecture  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Testing:** Cypress (E2E Testing)  
- **Design Patterns:** Implements Command, Strategy, Observer, and Factory patterns to enhance maintainability
- **Other Features:** Custom Hooks, Component-based UI, Routing Management
