- **RESTful APIs** â€“ CRUD operations for questions, answers, and user interactions  
- **Pagination & Form Validation** â€“ Ensuring structured data input and smooth navigation
- **Custom Hooks & Factory Pattern** â€“ Modularized UI logic and routing management  
- **End-to-End Testing with Cypress** â€“ Validating UI behavior and core functionalities   

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, MVVM Architecture  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Testing:** Cypress (E2E Testing)  
- **Design Patterns:** Implements Command, Strategy, Observer, and Factory patterns to enhance maintainability
- **Other Features:** Custom Hooks, Component-based UI, Routing Management
